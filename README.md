Duc V.

  I'm a new programmer. I like to program because I mostly spend my time with online games and I got attracted by those games. I learn how to program because I want to know how did the video games were made. 
  This project is about what I've learned and experience as a programmer in this year. This project contains my works and my experience in programming. In this year, I learned how to use HTML, CSS and JS to make a website, to make games and apps. I learned to organize my code in proper and cleaner way. 
  In my portfolio site, you will see 2 sections, About Me and Project Section. About Me section is section that about me as a programmer. The other section is about my projects that I made.
  There are 3 projects in my portfolio: Clocl, Tic Tac Toe and Pong. The clock project is about an analog clock that runs based on real time. The other 2 are about games and you can play them.
